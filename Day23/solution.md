### Solution

This task is pretty simple and straight forward. Follow below steps:

- Login into UI with given user password
- Click on the repository (at right sidebar)
- Click on the fork option (top right)

#### Notes:
- A Git fork is an independent copy of a Git repository, typically hosted on a platform like GitHub or GitLab. It essentially creates a personal version of a project that you can modify without directly affecting the original "upstream" repository.

Here's a breakdown of what a Git fork entails:
- Independent Copy: When you fork a repository, you get a complete copy of its code, branches, and history in your own account. This copy is separate from the original, allowing you to make changes and experiment freely without needing direct write access to the original repository.
- Ownership: The forked repository becomes yours, meaning you have full control over it and can manage its branches, commits, and other aspects as you see fit.
- Open-Source Contribution: Forking is a common workflow in open-source projects. Contributors can fork a project, make their desired changes or additions, and then propose these changes back to the original project maintainers through a "pull request" (or "merge request" on GitLab).
- Personal Development: You can also fork a repository to use it as a starting point for your own project or to iterate on ideas without impacting the original codebase.
- Upstream Connection: While a fork is independent, it maintains a connection to the original "upstream" repository. This allows you to pull in updates from the original project to keep your fork synchronized, and to submit your changes back to the upstream through pull requests.
